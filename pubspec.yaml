# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

    # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
    # the material Icons class.

    # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
    assets:
        - images/
        - images/store_items/
        - assets/anim.flr
        - assets/anim2.flr

    fonts:
        - family: Rammetto
          fonts:
              - asset: fonts/RammettoOne-Regular.ttf

    #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
    #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

    # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
    #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
    #         style: italic
    #   - family: Trajan Pro
    #     fonts:
    #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
    #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
    #         weight: 700
    #
    # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
